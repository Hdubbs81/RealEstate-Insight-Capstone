    "The New York City (NYC) housing market is one of the most dynamic and complex real estate environments in the world. With its diverse neighborhoods, fluctuating demand, and unique economic pressures, predicting housing prices in NYC poses a significant challenge. This capstone project aims to develop a robust housing price prediction model tailored specifically for NYC, leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and comprehensive data analysis."

    "    - Optimized for speed, XGBoost can handle large datasets efficiently, making it suitable for extensive real estate datasets.\n",

    "    - Provides insights into the importance of different features, helping to identify key factors influencing housing prices.\n",
    "- **Early Stopping:**\n",

    "    - Integrated support for k-fold cross-validation allows for robust model evaluation and tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cons of Using XGBoost Regressor for House Price Prediction\n",

    "    - XGBoost has many hyperparameters that need tuning, which can be time-consuming and requires expertise to achieve optimal performance.\n",
    "- **Resource Intensive:**\n",
    "    - Training XGBoost models can be computationally intensive, requiring significant memory and processing power, especially for very large datasets.\n",
    "- **Risk of Overfitting:**\n",
    "    - Despite regularization, there is still a risk of overfitting if the model is not properly tuned or if early stopping is not correctly implemented."
