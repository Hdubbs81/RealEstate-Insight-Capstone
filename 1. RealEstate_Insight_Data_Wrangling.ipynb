To do this we looked to validate that single family homes did not contain more than 15 bedrooms as this amount of bedrooms would not make sense for a single family home but would be more appropriate for a multi-family home. We noted there were 5 properties that met this criteria. Upon further analysis shown below, we updated the house type of 2 of the properties to reflect them being multi-family properties (validated by a google search). We removed the remaining properties from our dataset as they could not be validated."
